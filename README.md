Stock Screener

These scripts scrape yahoo's pages for today and tomorrow's companies which are posting quarterly results.

If the EPS estimates are positive and everything looks good, the stock symbol is added to the list.

printstocks.py simply prints the list to stdout, giving something that looks like sample.txt

emailstocks.py emails the list in a pretty html table, and includes links to each stock's page on yahoo.
